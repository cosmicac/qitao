      <div>
        I&apos;m Tom, a software engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I currently work at
        Affinity.
      </div>
      <div>
        I&apos;m a generalist at heart, but my skillset leans backend. I like to put my product hat
        on and collaborate closely with product and design.
      </div>
      <div>
        In my spare time, I like to watch basketball (go Warriors & Valkyries!), play video games,
        and work on various side projects.
